<h1> The best movies of all time </h1>
<h2> here are some movies that I love! </h2>
<hr>
<h3> Call Me By Your Name </h3>
<p>This movie was an absolute best, made me cry non stop while watching. On a scale of 1 to 10, a solid 9. </p>
<h3> Big Hero 6 </h3>
A definite 10 from my side. The animation, the characters, the plots, the fighting scenes were smooth for real. Have watched it over 
10 times and can say it is one of my comfort movies of all time.
<h3> Titanic </h3>
<p>Can't say it was the best but surely a masterpiece. Loved the chemistry b/w both the actors, 
    it had some scenes which can make you sob. The no go for me has to be the ending where the lady threw her neckpiece in the water.
     overall a 7 out of 10.</p>
